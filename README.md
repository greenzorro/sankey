However, I made some improvements to it. With an extra Excel file, it's now possible to set diagram data in two well organized spread sheets, one for nodes and the other for links, rather than doing it in the tricky json way. Save the two sheets as .csv files, then the code reads data from them and inserts it to the json structure.
